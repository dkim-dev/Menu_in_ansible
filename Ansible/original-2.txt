The following loops are supported by Ansible:

Simple loops:

- yum:
  name: postfix
  state: latest

- yum:
  name: dovecot
  state: latest


These two similar tasks using the yum module can be rewritten with a simple loop so that only
one task is needed to install both packages:


- yum:
   name: "{{ item }}"
   state: latest
  with_items:
   - postfix
   - dovecot



The following loops are supported by Ansible:

vars:
 mail_services:
  - postfix
  - dovecot

tasks:
  - yum:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: latest
  with_items: "{{ mail_services }}"


The following loops are supported by Ansible:


List of hashes: When passing arrays as arguments, the array can be a list of hashes. The
following snippet shows how a multidimensional array (an array with key-pair values) is passed to the user module in order to customize both the name and the group:


- user:
   name: "{{ item.name }}"
   state: present
   groups: "{{ item.groups }}"
 with_items:
   - { name: 'jane', groups: 'wheel' }
